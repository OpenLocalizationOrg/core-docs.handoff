Counters of this type display the difference between the queue lengths observed during the last two sample intervals, divided by the duration of the interval. This counter type is the same as <strong>CountPerTimeInterval32</strong> except that it uses larger fields to accommodate larger values. This type of counter is typically used to track a high-volume or very large number of items that are queued or waiting.</p>\\n\"\n  syntax:\n    content: CountPerTimeInterval64 = 4523264\n    return:\n      type: System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType\n  modifiers.csharp:\n  - public\n  - const\n  modifiers.vb:\n  - Public\n  - Const\n  nameWithType: PerformanceCounterType.CountPerTimeInterval64\n- uid: System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType.ElapsedTime\n  commentId: F:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType.ElapsedTime\n  id: ElapsedTime\n  parent: System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  - vb\n  name: ElapsedTime\n  fullName: System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType.ElapsedTime\n  type: Field\n  source:\n    remote:\n      path: src/System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter/ref/System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.cs\n      branch: master\n      repo: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx.git\n    id: ElapsedTime\n    path: src/System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter/ref/System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.cs\n    startLine: 87\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter\n  namespace: System.Diagnostics\n  summary: \"\\n<p>A difference timer that shows the total time between when the component or process started and the time when this value is calculated.</p>\\n\"\n  syntax:\n    content: ElapsedTime = 807666944\n    return:\n      type: System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType\n  modifiers.csharp:\n  - public\n  - const\n  modifiers.vb:\n  - Public\n  - Const\n  nameWithType: PerformanceCounterType.ElapsedTime\n- uid: System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType.NumberOfItems32\n  commentId: F:System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType.NumberOfItems32\n  id: NumberOfItems32\n  parent: System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType\n  langs:\n  - csharp\n  - vb\n  name: NumberOfItems32\n  fullName: System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterType.NumberOfItems32\n  type: Field\n  source:\n    remote:\n      path: src/System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter/ref/System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.cs\n      branch: master\n      repo: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx.git\n    id: NumberOfItems32\n    path: src/System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter/ref/System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter.cs\n    startLine: 88\n  assemblies:\n  - System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter\n  namespace: System.Diagnostics\n  summary: \"\\n<p>An instantaneous counter that shows the most recently observed value.
