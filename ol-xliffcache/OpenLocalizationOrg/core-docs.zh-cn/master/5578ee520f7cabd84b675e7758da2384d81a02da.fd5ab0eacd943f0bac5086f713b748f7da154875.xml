Samples\n\n**Note:** This document is  compatible with tooling that is still in active development.  Details are subject to change over time.\n\nThese samples are buildable projects whose source is used for code snippets in [the guide for writing cross-platform libraries](../../../docs/core/tutorials/libraries.md).  They can be built and run using the .NET Core RC1 toolchain, and are intended to simply demonstrate how to target and build NuGet packages for different targets.  They aren't examples of how you'd build a real, feature-complete library.\n\nTo build/use any of these (using `new-library` as an example):\n\n1. Open your favorite Command Line Interface (e.g. Cmd.exe or Terminal).\n\n2. Navigate to the top-level directory:\n\n    `$ cd new-library`\n\n3. Restore packages by typing the following:\n\n    `$ dotnet restore`\n        \n4. To build and package the library as a NuGet package, type the following:\n\n    `$ cd src/Library`\n    \n    `$ dotnet build`\n    \n    `$ dotnet pack`\n    \n    Check out the `/bin/Debug` directory to see the generated artifacts and `.nupkg`.\n\n5.
