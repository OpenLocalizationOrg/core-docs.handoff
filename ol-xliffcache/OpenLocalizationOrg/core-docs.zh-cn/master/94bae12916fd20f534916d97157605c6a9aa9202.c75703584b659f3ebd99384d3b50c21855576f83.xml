This article\nbriefly introduces unit tests (and how they differ from other kinds of tests).\nLinked resources demonstrates how to add a test project to your solution and\nthen run unit tests using either the command line or Visual Studio.\n\n## Getting Started with Testing\n \nHaving a suite of automated tests is one of the best ways to ensure a\nsoftware application does what its authors intended it to do. There are\nmany different kinds of tests for software applications, including integration\ntests, web tests, load tests, and many others. At the lowest level are\nunit tests, which test individual software components or methods. Unit\ntests should only test code within the developer’s control, and should\nnot test infrastructure concerns, like databases, file systems, or\nnetwork resources. Unit tests may be written using\n[Test Driven Development (TDD)](http://deviq.com/test-driven-development/),\nor they can be added to existing code to confirm its correctness. In\neither case, they should be small, well-named, and fast, since ideally\nyou will want to be able to run hundreds of them before pushing your\nchanges into the project’s shared code repository.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Developers often struggle with coming up with good names for their\n> test classes and methods. As a starting point, the ASP.NET product\n> team follows\n> [these conventions](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/wiki/Engineering-guidelines#unit-tests-and-functional-tests).\n\nWhen writing unit tests, be careful you don’t accidentally introduce\ndependencies on infrastructure. These tend to make tests slower and\nmore brittle, and thus should be reserved for integration tests. You\ncan avoid these hidden dependencies in your application code by following\nthe [Explicit Dependencies Principle](http://deviq.com/explicit-dependencies-principle/)\nand using [Dependency Injection](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/fundamentals/dependency-injection.html)\nto request your dependencies from the framework. You can also keep your\nunit tests in a separate project from your integration tests, and ensure\nyour unit test project doesn’t have references to or dependencies on\ninfrastructure packages.\n\nLearn more about unit testing in .NET Core projects:\n\nTry this [walkthrough creating unit tests with xunit and the .NET CLI](unit-testing-with-dotnet-test.md).\n\nThe XUnit team has written a tutorial that shows\n[how to use xunit with .NET Core and Visual Studio](http://xunit.github.io/docs/getting-started-dotnet-core.html).\n"}
