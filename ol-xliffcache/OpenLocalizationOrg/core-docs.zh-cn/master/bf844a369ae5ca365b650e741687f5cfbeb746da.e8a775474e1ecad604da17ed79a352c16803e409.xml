\notherwise, it falls back to non-incremental compilation. Via a profile flag, users can choose to receive additional \ninformation on how they can improve their build times.\n\nAll projects in the dependency graph that need compilation must pass the following safety checks in order for the \ncompilation process to be incremental:\n- not use pre/post compile scripts\n- not load compilation tools from PATH (for example, resgen, compilers)\n- use only known compilers (csc, vbc, fsc)\n\nIn order to build an executable application, you need a special configuration section in your project.json file:\n\n```json\n{ \n    \"compilerOptions\": {\n      \"emitEntryPoint\": true\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## OPTIONS\n\n`-o`, `--output` [DIR]\n\nDirectory in which to place the built binaries. \n\n`-b`, `--build-base-path` [DIR]\n\nDirectory in which to place temporary outputs.\n\n`-f`, `--framework` [FRAMEWORK]\n\nCompiles for a specific framework. The framework needs to be defined in the project.json file.\n\n`-c`, `--configuration` [Debug|Release]\n\nDefines a configuration under which to build.  If omitted, it defaults to Debug.\n\n`-r`, `--runtime` [RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER]\n\nTarget runtime to build for. \n\n`--version-suffix` [VERSION_SUFFIX]\n\nDefines what `*` should be replaced with in the version field in the project.json file. The format follows NuGet's version guidelines. \n\n`--build-profile`\n\nPrints out the incremental safety checks that users need to address in order for incremental compilation to be automatically turned on.\n\n`--no-incremental`\n\nMarks the build as unsafe for incremental build. This turns off incremental compilation and forces a clean rebuild of the project dependency graph.\n\n`--no-dependencies`\n\nIgnores project-to-project references and only builds the root project specified to build.\n"}
