NAME\n\n`dotnet-test` - Runs unit tests using the configured test runner\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n`dotnet test [--configuration]  \n    [--output] [--build-base-path] [--framework] [--runtime]\n    [--no-build]\n    [--parentProcessId] [--port]  \n    [<project>]`  \n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\nThe `dotnet test` command is used to execute unit tests in a given project. Unit tests are class library \nprojects that have dependencies on the unit test framework (for example, NUnit or xUnit) and the \ndotnet test runner for that unit testing framework. \nThese are packaged as NuGet packages and are restored as ordinary dependencies for the project.\n\nTest projects also need to specify a test runner property in project.json using the \"testRunner\" node. \nThis value should contain the name of the unit test framework.\n\nThe following sample project.json shows the properties needed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0-*\",\n  \"buildOptions\": {\n    \"debugType\": \"portable\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"System.Runtime.Serialization.Primitives\": \"4.1.1\",\n    \"xunit\": \"2.1.0\",\n    \"dotnet-test-xunit\": \"1.0.0-rc2-192208-24\"\n  },\n  \"testRunner\": \"xunit\",\n  \"frameworks\": {\n    \"netcoreapp1.0\": {\n      \"dependencies\": {\n        \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": {\n          \"type\": \"platform\",\n          \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"imports\": [\n        \"dotnet5.4\",\n        \"portable-net451+win8\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n`dotnet test` supports two running modes:\n\n1. Console: In console mode, `dotnet test` simply executes fully any command gets passed to it and outputs the results. Anytime you invoke `dotnet test` without passing --port, it runs in console mode, which in turn will cause the runner to run in console mode.\n2. Design time: used in the context of other tools, such as editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). You can find out more about this mode in the [dotnet-test protocol](test-protocol.md) document. \n\n## OPTIONS\n\n`[project]`\n    \nSpecifies a path to the test project. If omitted, it defaults to current directory. \n\n`-c`, `--configuration` [Debug|Release]\n\nConfiguration under which to build. The default value is Release. \n\n`-o`, `--output` [DIR]\n\nDirectory in which to find binaries to run.\n\n`-b`, `--build-base-path` [DIR]\n\nDirectory in which to place temporary outputs.\n\n`-f`, `--framework` [FRAMEWORK]\n\nLooks for test binaries for a specific framework.\n\n`-r`, `--runtime` [RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER]\n\nLook for test binaries for a for the specified runtime.\n\n`--no-build` \n\nDoes not build the test project prior to running it. \n\n--parentProcessId\n\nUsed by IDEs to specify their process ID. Test will exit if the parent process does.\n\n`--port`\n\nUsed by IDEs to specify a port number to listen for a connection.\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n`dotnet test`\n\nRuns the tests in the project in the current directory. \n\n`dotnet test /projects/test1/project.json`\n\nRuns the tests in the test1 project. \n\n## SEE ALSO\n\n* [dotnet-test communication protocol](test-protocol.md)\n"}
