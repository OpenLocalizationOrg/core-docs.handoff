Invoked on its own, it will give out brief usage instructions. \n\nEach specific feature is implemented as a command. In order to use the feature, the command is specified after `dotnet`, such as [`dotnet build`](dotnet-build.md). All of the arguments following the command are its own arguments. \n\nThe only time `dotnet` is used as a command on its own is to run portable apps. Just specify a portable application DLL after the `dotnet` verb to execute the application.    \n\n\n## OPTIONS\n`-v, --verbose`\n\nEnables verbose output.\n\n`--version`\n\nPrints out the version of the CLI tooling.\n\n`--info`\n\nPrints out more detailed information about the CLI tooling, such as the current operating system, commit SHA for the version, etc. \n\n`-h, --help`\n\nPrints out a short help and a list of current commands. \n\n## DOTNET COMMANDS\n\nThe following commands exist for dotnet:\n\n* [dotnet-new](dotnet-new.md)\n   * Initializes a C# or F# console application project.\n* [dotnet-restore](dotnet-restore.md)\n  * Restores the dependencies for a given application. \n* [dotnet-build](dotnet-build.md)\n  * Builds a .NET Core application.\n* [dotnet-publish](dotnet-publish.md)\n   * Publishes a .NET portable or self-contained application.\n* [dotnet-run](dotnet-run.md)\n   * Runs the application from source.\n* [dotnet-test](dotnet-test.md)\n   * Runs tests using a test runner specified in the project.json.\n* [dotnet-pack](dotnet-pack.md)\n   * Creates a NuGet package of your code.\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n`dotnet new`\n\nInitializes a sample .NET Core console application that can be compiled and run.\n\n`dotnet restore`\n\nRestores dependencies for a given application. \n\n`dotnet compile`\n\nCompiles the application in a given directory. \n\n`dotnet myapp.dll`\n\nRuns a portable app named `myapp.dll`. \n\n## ENVIRONMENT \n\n`DOTNET_PACKAGES`\n\nThe primary package cache. If not set, it defaults to $HOME/.nuget/packages on Unix or %HOME%\\NuGet\\Packages on Windows.\n\n`DOTNET_SERVICING`\n\nSpecifies the location of the servicing index to use by the shared host when loading the runtime.\n\n`DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`\n\nSpecifies whether data about the .NET Core tools usage is collected and sent to Microsoft. **true** to opt-out of the telemetry feature (values true, 1 or yes accepted); otherwise, **false** (values false, 0 or no accepted). If not set, it defaults to **false**, that is, the telemetry feature is on.\n"}
