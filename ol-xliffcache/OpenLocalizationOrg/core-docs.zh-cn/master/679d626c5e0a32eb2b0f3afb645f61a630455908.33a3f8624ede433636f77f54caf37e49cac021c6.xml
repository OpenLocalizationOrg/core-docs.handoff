You can download the scripts from our [CLI GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tree/rel/1.0.0-preview2/scripts/obtain). \n\nTheir main use case is to help with automation scenarios and non-admin installations. There are two scripts, one for PowerShell that works on Windows and a bash script that works on Linux/OS X. They both have the same behavior. Bash script also \"understands\" PowerShell switches so you can use them across the board. \n\nInstallation scripts will download the ZIP/tarball file from the CLI build drops and will proceed to install it in either the default location or in a location specified by `--install-dir`. By default, the installation script \nwill download the SDK and install it; if you want to get just the shared runtime, you can specify the `--shared-runtime` argument. \n\nBy default, the script will add the install location to the $PATH for the current session. This can be overridden if the `--no-path` argument is used. \n\nBefore running the script, please install all the required [dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md).\n\nYou can install a specific version using the `--version` argument. The version needs to be specified as 3-part version (for example 1.0.0-13232). If omitted, it will default to the first global.json file found in the hierarchy above the folder where the script was invoked in that contains the `sdkVersion` property. If that is not present, it will use Latest.\n\nYou can also use this script to get the SDK or shared runtime debug binaries with debug symbols by using the `--debug` argument. If you do not do this on first install and realize you do need debug symbols later on, you can re-run the script with this argument and the version of the bits you installed. \n\n## Options\nOptions are different between script implementations. \n\n### PowerShell (Windows)\n`-Channel [CHANNEL]`\n\nWhich channel (for example, \"future\", \"preview\", \"production\") to install from. The default value is \"Production\".\n\n`-Version [VERSION]`\n\nWhich version of CLI to install; you need to specify the version as 3-part version (i.e. 1.0.0-13232). If omitted, it will default to the first global.json that contains the sdkVersion property; if that is not present, it will use Latest.  \n\n`-InstallDir [DIR]`\n\nPath to install to. The directory is created if it doesn't exist. The default value is `%LocalAppData%\\.dotnet`.\n\n`-Debug`\n\n**true** to indicate that larger packages containing debugging symbols should be used; otherwise, **false**. The default value is **false**.\n\n`-NoPath`\n\n**true** to indicate that the prefix/installdir are not exported to the path for the current session; otherwise, **false**. \nThe default value is **false**, that is, the PATH is modified. \nThis makes the CLI tools available immediately after install. \n\n`-SharedRuntime`\n\n**true** to install just the shared runtime bits; **false** to install the entire SDK. The default value is **false**.\n\n### Bash (OS X/Linux)\n`--channel [CHANNEL]`\n\nWhich channel (for example \"future\", \"preview\", \"production\") to install from. The default value is \"Production\".\n\n`--version [VERSION]`\n\nWhich version of CLI to install; you need to specify the version as 3-part version (i.e. 1.0.0-13232). If omitted, it will default to the first global.json that contains the sdkVersion property; if that is not present, it will use Latest.  \n\n`--install-dir [DIR]`\n\nPath to where to install. The directory is created if it doesn't exist. The default value is `$HOME/.dotnet`.\n\n`--debug`\n\n**true** to indicate that larger packages containing debugging symbols should be used; otherwise, **false**. The default value is **false**.\n\n`--no-path`\n\n**true** to indicate that the prefix/installdir are not exported to the path for the current session; otherwise, **false**. \nThe default value is **false**, that is, the PATH is modified. \nThis makes the CLI tools available immediately after install.  \n\n`--shared-runtime`\n\n**true** to install just the shared runtime bits; **false** to install the entire SDK. The default value is **false**.\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\nWindows:\n\n```\n./dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel Future\n```\n\nOS X/Linux:\n\n```\n./dotnet-install.sh --channel Future\n```\n\nInstalls the dev latest version to the default location.\n\nWindows:\n\n```\n./dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel preview -InstallDir C:\\cli\n```\n\nOS X/Linux:\n\n```\n./dotnet-install.sh --channel preview --install-dir ~/cli\n```\n\nInstalls the latest preview to the specified location.\n"}
