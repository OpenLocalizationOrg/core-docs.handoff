The `var` declaration\ntells the compiler to figure out the type of the variable from the type\nof expression on the right hand side of the assignment operator. A lambda\nexpression does not have a compile time type, but is convertible to any\nmatching delegate or expression type. When you assign a lambda expression\nto a variable of a delegate or expression type, you tell the compiler to\ntry and convert the lambda expression into an expression or delegate that\nmatches the signature of the 'assigned to' variable.
