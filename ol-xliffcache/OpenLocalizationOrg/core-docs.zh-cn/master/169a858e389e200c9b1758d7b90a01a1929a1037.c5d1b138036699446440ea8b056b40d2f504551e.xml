RIDs are used to identify target operating systems where an application or asset \n(that is, assembly) will run. They look like this: \"ubuntu.14.04-x64\", \"win7-x64\", \"osx.10.11-x64\". \nFor the packages with native dependencies, it will designate on which platforms the package can be restored. \n\nIt is important to note that RIDs are really opaque strings. This means that they have to match exactly for operations \nusing them to work. As an example, let us consider the case of [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), which is a straightforward clone of \nUbuntu 14.04. Although .NET Core and CLI work on top of that version of Ubuntu, if you try to use them on Elementary OS \nwithout any modifications, the restore operation for any package will fail. This is because we currently (May 3rd, 2016) don't \nhave a RID that designates Elementary OS as a platform. \n\nRIDs that represent concrete operating systems should be of the form: `[os].[version]-[arch]` where:\n- `[os]` is the operating system moniker, for example, `win`\n- `[version]` is the operating system version in the form of a dot (`.`) separated version number, for example, `10.1511`, \naccurate enough to reasonably enable assets to target operating system platform APIs represented by that version.\n  - This **shouldn't** be marketing versions, as they often represent multiple discrete versions of the operating \nsystem with varying platform API surface area, for example, `win.10-x64`\n- `[arch]` is the processor architecture, for example, `x86`, `x64`, `arm`, `arm64`, etc.\n\nThe RID graph is defined in a package called `Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms` in a file called `runtime.json` which you can \nsee on the [CoreFX repo](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/pkg/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/runtime.json). If \nyou use this file, you will notice that some of the RIDs have an `\"#import\"` statement in them. These statements are \ncompatibility statements. That means that a RID that has an imported RID in it, can be a target for restoring packages \nfor that RID. Slightly confusing, but let's look at an example. Let's take a look at macOS:\n\n```json\n\"osx.10.11-x64\": {\n            \"#import\": [ \"osx.10.11\", \"osx.10.10-x64\" ]\n}\n```\nThe above RID specifies that `osx.10.11-x64` imports `osx.10.10-x64`. This means that when restoring packages, NuGet will\nbe able to restore packages that specify that they need `osx.10.10-x64` on `osx.10.11-x64`.\n\nA slightly bigger example RID graph:  \n\n- `win.10.1511-x64`\n  - `win.10.1511`\n  - `win.10-x64`\n    - `win.10`\n    - `win.6.3.9200-x64`\n      - `win.6.3-x64`\n      - `win.6.3`\n      - `win.6.3.9200`\n      - `win.6.2.9200-x64`\n        - `win.6.2.9200`\n        - `win.6.1.7600-x64`\n          - `win.6.1.7600`\n          - `win.6.1-x64`\n            - `win.6.1`\n              - `win`\n                - `any`\n\nAll RIDs eventually map back to the root `any` RID.\n\nAlthough they look easy enough to use, there are some special things about RIDs that you have to keep in mind when \nworking with them:\n\n* They are **opaque strings** and should be treated as black boxes\n    * You should not construct RIDs programmatically\n* You need to use the RIDs that are already defined for the platform and this document shows that\n* The RIDs do need to be specific so don't assume anything from the actual RID value; please consult this document \nto determine which RID(s) you need for a given platform\n\n## Using RIDs\nIn order to use RIDs, you have to know which RIDs there are.
