its dependencies into a folder getting it ready for publishing\n\n## SYNOPSIS\n\n`dotnet publish [--framework]  \n    [--runtime] [--build-base-path] [--output]  \n    [--version-suffix] [--configuration]  \n    [<project>]`  \n\n## DESCRIPTION\n\n`dotnet publish` compiles the application, reads through its dependencies specified in the `project.json` file and publishes the resulting set of files to a directory. \n\nDepending on the type of portable app, the resulting directory will contain the following:\n\n1. **Portable application** - application's intermediate language (IL) code and all of application's managed dependencies.\n    * **Portable application with native dependencies** - same as above with a sub-directory for the supported platform of each native\n    dependency. \n2. **Self-contained application** - same as above plus the entire runtime for the targeted platform.\n\nThe above types are covered in more details in the [types of portable applications](../app-types.md) topic.\n\n## OPTIONS\n\n`[project]` \n    \n`dotnet publish` needs access to the `project.json` file to work. If it is not specified on invocation via [project], `project.json` in the current directory will be the default.     \nIf no `project.json` can be found, `dotnet publish` will throw an error. \n\n`-f`, `--framework` [FID]\n\nPublishes the application for a given framework identifier (FID). If not specified, FID is read from `project.json`. In no valid framework is found, the command will throw an error. If multiple valid frameworks are found, the command will publish for all valid frameworks. \n\n\n`-r`, `--runtime` [RID]\n\nPublishes the application for a given runtime. \n\n`-b`, `--build-base-path` [DIR]\n\nDirectory in which to place temporary outputs.\n\n`-o`, `--output`\n\nSpecify the path where to place the directory. If not specified, it will default to _./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/_ \nfor portable applications or _./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/[runtime]_ for self-contained applications.\n\n--version-suffix [VERSION_SUFFIX]\n\nDefines what `*` should be replaced with in the version field in the project.json file.\n\n`-c`, `--configuration [Debug|Release]`\n\nConfiguration to use when publishing. The default value is Debug.\n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n`dotnet publish`\n\nPublishes an application using the framework found in `project.json`. If `project.json` contains `runtimes` node, publish for the RID of the current platform.\n\n`dotnet publish ~/projects/app1/project.json`\n    \nPublishes the application using the specified `project.json`.\n    \n`dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp1.0`\n    \nPublishes the current application using the `netcoreapp1.0` framework.\n    \n`dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp1.0 --runtime osx.10.11-x64`\n    \nPublishes the current application using the `netcoreapp1.0` framework and runtime for `OS X 10.10`. This RID has to \nexist in the `project.json` `runtimes` node.\n"}
