You can not only examine that code. You can build new\nexpression trees that represent modified versions of the original code.\n\nYou can also use expression trees to look at an algorithm, and\ntranslate that algorithm into another language or environment. \n\n## Limitations\n\nThere are some newer C# language elements that don't translate\nwell into expression trees. Expression trees cannot contain\n`await` expressions, or `async` lambda expressions. Many of the\nfeatures added in the C# 6 release don't appear exactly as written\nin expression trees. Instead, newer features will be exposed\nin expressions trees in the equivalent, earlier syntax. This\nmay not be as much of a limitation as you might think. In fact,\nit means that your code that interprets expression trees will likely\nstill work the same when new language features are introduced.\n\nEven with these limitations, expression trees do enable you to\ncreate dynamic algorithms that rely on interpreting and modifying\ncode that is represetned as a data structure. It's a powerful\ntool, and it's one of the features of the .NET ecosystem that\nenables rich libraries such as Entity Framework to accomplish\nwhat they do.\n\n"}
