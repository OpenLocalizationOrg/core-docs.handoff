teaches you a number of features in .NET Core and the C# language. You’ll learn:\n*   The basics of the .NET Core Command Line Interface (CLI).\n*   The structure of a C# Console Application.\n*   Console I/O.\n*   The basics of File I/O APIS in .NET Core\n*   The basics of the Task Asynchronous Programming Model in .NET Core. \n\nYou’ll build an application that reads a text file, and echoes the\ncontents of that text file to the console. The output to the console will\nbe paced to match reading it aloud. You can speed up or slow down the pace\nby pressing the ‘<’ or ‘>’ keys.\n\nThere are a lot of features in this tutorial. Let’s build them one by one. \n## Prerequisites\nYou’ll need to setup your machine to run .NET core. You can find the\ninstallation instructions on the [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)\npage. You can run this\napplication on Windows, Linux, macOS or in a Docker container. \nYou’ll need to install your favorite code editor. \n## Create the Application\nThe first step is to create a new application. Open a command prompt and\ncreate a new directory for your application. Make that the current\ndirectory. Type the command \"dotnet new\" at the command prompt. This\ncreates the starter files for a basic “Hello World” application.\n\nBefore you start making modifications, let’s go through the steps to run\nthe simple Hello World application. After creating the application, type\n\"dotnet restore\" at the command prompt. This command runs the NuGet\npackage restore process. NuGet is a .NET package manager. This command\ndownloads any of the missing dependencies for your project. As this is a\nnew project, none of the dependencies are in place, so the first run will\ndownload the .NET Core framework. After this initial step, you will only\nneed to run dotnet restore when you add new dependent packages, or update\nthe versions of any of your dependencies. This process also creates the\nproject lock file (project.lock.json) in your project directory. This file\nhelps to manage the project dependencies. It contains the local location\nof all the project dependencies. You do not need to put the file in source\ncontrol; it will be generated when you run “dotnet restore”. \n\nAfter restoring packages, you run “dotnet build”. This executes the build\nengine and creates your application executable. Finally, you execute “dotnet run” to\nrun your application.  \n\nThe simple Hello World application code is all in Program.cs. Open that\nfile with your favorite text editor. We’re about to make our first changes.\nAt the top of the file, see a using statement:\n\n```cs\nusing System;\n```\n\nThis statement tells the compiler that any types from the System namespace\nare in scope. Like other Object Oriented languages you may have used, C#\nuses namespaces to organize types. This hello world program is no\ndifferent. You can see that the program is enclosed in the\n`ConsoleApplication` namespace. That’s not a very descriptive name, so\nchange it to `TeleprompterConsole`.\n\n```cs\nnamespace TeleprompterConsole\n```\n\n## Reading and Echoing the File\nThe first feature to add is to read a text file, and display all that text\nto the console. First, let’s add a text file. Copy the \n[sampleQuotes.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs/blob/master/samples/csharp-language/console-teleprompter/sampleQuotes.txt)\nfile from the GitHub repository for this [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs/tree/master/samples/csharp-language/console-teleprompter) into your project directory. \nThis will serve as the script for your\napplication.\n\nNext, add the following method in your Program class (right below the Main \nmethod):\n\n```cs\nstatic IEnumerable<string> ReadFrom(string file)\n{\n    string line;\n    using (var reader = File.OpenText(file))\n    {\n        while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)\n        {\n            yield return line;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis method uses types from two new namespaces. For this to compile you’ll \nneed to add the following two lines to the top of the file:\n\n```cs\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\n```\n\nThe `IEnumerable<T>` interface is defined in the \n`System.Collections.Generic` namespace. The File class is defined in the\n`System.IO namespace`.\n\nThis method is a special type of C# method called an *Enumerator method*. \nEnumerator methods return sequences that are evaluated lazily. That means \neach item in the sequence is generated as it is requested by the code \nconsuming the sequence. Enumerator methods are methods that contain one or \nmore `yield return` statements. The object returned by the `ReadFrom()` \nmethod contains the code to generate each item in the sequence. In this \nexample, that involves reading the next line of text from the source file, \nand returning that string. Each time the calling code requests the next \nitem from the sequence, the code reads the next line of text from the file\nand returns it. When the file has been completely read, the sequence \nindicates that there are no more items.\n\nThere are two other C# syntax elements that may be new to you. The `using` \nstatement in this method manages resource cleanup. The variable that is\ninitialized in the using statement (`reader`, in this example) must\nimplement the `IDisposable` interface. The `IDisposable` interface\ndefines a single method, `Dispose()`, that should be called when the\nresource should be released. The compiler generates that call when\nexecution reaches the closing brace of the `using` statement. The\ncompiler-generated code ensures that the resource is released even if an\nexception is thrown from the code in the block defined by the using\nstatement.\n\nThe reader variable is defined using the `var` keyword. `var` defines an\n*implicitly typed local variable*. That means the type of the variable is\ndetermined by the compile time type of the object assigned to the\nvariable. Here, that is the return value from `File.OpenText()`, which is\na `StreamReader` object.\n \nNow, let’s fill in the code to read the file in the Main method: \n\n```cs\nvar lines = ReadFrom(\"SampleQuotes.txt\");\nforeach (var line in lines)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(line); \n}\n```\n\nRun the program (using \"dotnet run\" and you can see every line printed out\nto the console.  \n\n## Adding Delays and Formatting output\nWhat you have is being displayed far too fast to read aloud. Now you need\nto add the delays in the output. As you start, you’ll be building some of\nthe core code that enables asynchronous processing. However, these first\nsteps will follow a few anti-patterns. The anti-patterns are pointed out\nin comments as you add the code, and the code will be updated in later\nsteps.\n\nThere are two steps to this section. First, you’ll update the iterator\nmethod to return single words instead of entire lines. That’s done with\nthese modifications. Replace the `yield return line;` statement with the\nfollowing code:\n\n```cs\nvar words = line.Split(' ');\nforeach (var word in words)\n{\n    yield return word + \" \";\n}\nyield return Environment.NewLine;\n```\n\nNext, you need to modify how you consume the lines of the file, and add a\ndelay after writing each word. Replace the `Console.WriteLine()` statement\nin the `Main` method with the following block:\n\n```cs\n{\n    Console.Write(line);\n    if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line))\n    {\n        var pause = Task.Delay(200);\n        // Synchronously waiting on a task is an\n        // anti-pattern. This will get fixed in later\n        // steps.\n        pause.Wait();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `Task` class is in the `System.Threading.Tasks` namespace, so you need\nto add that using statement at the top of file:\n\n```cs\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\n```\n\n> Note: In RC2, you need to run the application using a different\n> command to see the correct output. This is due to an issue\n> in the CLI that [has been filed](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/2976).\n> To run the application, instead of `dotnet run` use\n> `dotnet .\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp1.0\\console-teleprompter.dll` \n> substituting the correct path to your output DLL.  \n\nRun the sample, and check the output. Now, each single word is printed,\nfollowed by a 200 ms delay. However, the displayed output shows some\nissues because the source text file has several lines that have more than\n80 characters without a line break. That can be hard to read while it's\nscrolling by. That’s easy to fix. You’ll just keep track of the length of\neach line, and generate a new line whenever the line length reaches a\ncertain threshold. Declare a local variable after the declaration of\n`words` that holds the line length:\n\n```cs\nvar lineLength = 0;\n```\n \nThen, add the following code after the `yield return word;` statement\n(before the closing brace):\n\n```cs\nlineLength += word.Length + 1;\nif (lineLength > 70)\n{\n    yield return Environment.NewLine;\n    lineLength = 0;\n}\n```\n \nRun the sample, and you’ll be able to read aloud at its pre-configured\npace.\n\n## Async Tasks\nIn this final step, you’ll add the code to write the output asynchronously\nin one task, while also running another task to read input from the user\nif they want to speed up or slow down the text display. This has a few\nsteps in it and by the end, you’ll have all the updates that you need.\nThe first step is to create an asynchronous `Task` returning method that\nrepresents the code you’ve created so far to read and display the file.\n\nAdd this method to your Program class: (It’s taken from the body of your\nMain method:\n\n```cs\nprivate static async Task ShowTeleprompter()\n{\n    var words = ReadFrom(\"SampleQuotes.txt\");\n    foreach (var line in words)\n    {\n        Console.Write(line);\n        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line))\n        {\n            await Task.Delay(200);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou’ll notice two changes. First, in the body of the method, instead of\ncalling `Wait()` to synchronously wait for a task to finish, this version\nuses the `await` keyword. In order to do that, you need to add the `async`\nmodifier to the method signature. This method returns a `Task`. Notice that\nthere are no return statements that return a Task object. Instead, that\n`Task` object is created by code the compiler generates when you use the\n`await` operator. You can imagine that this method returns when it reaches\nan `await`. The returned Task indicates that the work has not completed.\nThe method resumes when the awaited task completes. When it has executed\nto completion, the returned `Task` indicates that it is complete.\nCalling code can\nmonitor that returned task to determine when it has completed.\n\nYou can call this new method in your Main program:\n\n```cs\nShowTeleprompter().Wait();\n```\n\nHere, in `Main()`, the code does synchronously wait. You should use the\n`await` operator instead of synchronously waiting whenever possible. But,\nin a console application’s `Main` method, you cannot use the `await`\noperator. That would result in the application exiting before all tasks\nhave completed.\n\nNext, you need to write the second asynchronous method to read from the\nConsole and watch for the ‘<’ and ‘>’ keys. Here’s the method you add for\nthat task:\n\n```cs\nprivate static async Task GetInput()\n{\n    var delay = 200;\n    Action work = () =>\n    {\n        do {\n            var key = Console.ReadKey(true);\n            if (key.KeyChar == '>')\n            {\n                delay -= 10;\n            }\n            else if (key.KeyChar == '<')\n            {\n                delay += 10;\n            }\n        } while (true);\n    };\n    await Task.Run(work);\n}\n```\n\nThis creates a lambda expression to represent an `Action` that reads a key\nfrom the Console and modifies a local variable representing the delay when\nthe user presses the ‘<’ or ‘>’ keys. This method uses `Console.ReadKey()`\nto block and wait for the user to press a key.\n\nTo finish this feature, you need to create a new async task returning\nmethod that starts both of these tasks (`GetInput()` and \n`ShowTeleprompter()`, and also manage the shared data between these two\ntasks.\n \nIt’s time to create a class that can handle the shared data between these\ntwo tasks. This class contains two public properties: the delay, and a\nflag to indicate that the file has been completely read:\n\n```cs\nnamespace TeleprompterConsole\n{\n    internal class TelePrompterConfig\n    {\n        private object lockHandle = new object();\n        public int DelayInMilliseconds { get; private set; } = 200;\n\n        public void UpdateDelay(int increment) // negative to speed up\n        {\n            var newDelay = Min(DelayInMilliseconds + increment, 1000);\n            newDelay = Max(newDelay, 20);\n            lock (lockHandle)\n            {\n                DelayInMilliseconds = newDelay;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPut that class in a new file, and enclose that class in the\n`TeleprompterConsole` namespace as shown above. You’ll also need to add a `static using`\nstatement so that you can reference the `Min` and `Max` method without the\nenclosing class or namespace names. A static using statement imports the\nmethods from one class. This is in contrast with the using statements used\nup to this point that have imported all classes from a namespace.\n\n```cs\nusing static System.Math;\n```\n\nThe other language feature that’s new is the `lock` statement. This\nstatement ensures that only a single thread can be in that code at any\ngiven time. If one thread is in the locked section, other threads must\nwait for the first thread to exit that section. The lock statement uses an\nobject that guards the lock section. This class follows a standard idiom\nto lock a private object in the class.\n\nNext, you need to update the `ShowTeleprompter` and `GetInput` methods to\nuse the new config object. Write one final Task returning async method to\nstart both tasks and exit when the first task finishes:\n\n```cs\nprivate static async Task RunTeleprompter()\n{\n    var config = new TelePrompterConfig();\n    var displayTask = ShowTeleprompter(config);\n\n    var speedTask = GetInput(config);\n    await Task.WhenAny(displayTask, speedTask);\n}\n```\n\nThe one new method here is the `Task.WhenAny()` call. That creates a Task\nthat finishes as soon as any of the tasks in its argument list completes.\n\nNext, you need to update both the ShowTeleprompter and GetInput methods to\nuse the config object for the delay:\n\n```cs\nprivate static async Task ShowTeleprompter(TelePrompterConfig config)\n{\n    var words = ReadFrom(\"SampleQuotes.txt\");\n    foreach (var line in words)\n    {\n        Console.Write(line);\n        if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line))\n        {\n            await Task.Delay(config.DelayInMilliseconds);\n        }\n    }\n    config.SetDone();\n}\n\nprivate static async Task GetInput(TelePrompterConfig config)\n{\n\n    Action work = () =>\n    {\n        do {\n            var key = Console.ReadKey(true);\n            if (key.KeyChar == '>')\n                config.UpdateDelay(-10);\n            else if (key.KeyChar == '<')\n                config.UpdateDelay(10);\n        } while (!config.Done);\n    };\n    await Task.Run(work);\n}\n```\n\nThis new version of `ShowTeleprompter` calls a new method in the\n`TeleprompterConfig` class. Now, you need to update Main to call \n`RunTeleprompter` instead of `ShowTeleprompter`:\n\n```cs\nRunTeleprompter().Wait();\n```\n\nTo finish, you'll need to add the\n`SetDone` method, and the `Done` property to the `TelePrompterConfig` class:\n\n```cs\npublic bool Done => done;\n\nprivate bool done;\n\npublic void SetDone()\n{\n    done = true;    \n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nThis tutorial showed you a number of the features around the C# language\nand the .NET Core libraries related to working in Console applications.\nYou can build on this knowledge to explore more about the language, and\nthe classes introduced here. You’ve seen the basics of File and Console\nI/O, blocking and non-blocking use of the Task based Asynchronous\nprogramming model, a tour of the C# language and how C# programs are\norganized and the .NET Core Command Line Interface and tools.\n \n"}
