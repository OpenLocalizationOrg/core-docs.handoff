This is the package that developers will most likely acquire. \n\nIt contains the following components:\n\n1. The .NET Core Command Line Tools that are used to build applications\n2. .NET Core (libraries and runtime) that allow applications to both be built and run\n3. The `dotnet` driver for running the CLI commands as well as running applications\n\n\n## Acquiring the .NET Core SDK\nAs with any tooling, the first thing is to get the tools to your machine. Depending on your scenario, you can either \nuse the native installers to install the SDK or use the installation shell script.\n\nThe native installers are primarily meant for developer's machines. The SDK is distributed using each supported platform's \nnative install mechanism, for instance DEB packages on Ubuntu or MSI bundles on Windows. These installers will install \nand set up the environment as needed for the user to use the SDK immediately after the install. However, they also \nrequire administrative privileges on the machine. You can view the installation instructions on the\n[.NET Core getting started page](https://aka.ms/dotnetcoregs).\n\nInstall scripts, on the other hand, do not require administrative privileges. However, they will also not install any \nprerequisites on the machine; you need to install all of the prerequisites manually. The scripts are meant mostly for \nsetting up build servers or when you wish to install the tools without admin privileges (do note the prerequisites \ncaveat above). You can find more information on the [install script reference topic](tools/dotnet-install-script.md). If you are \ninterested in how to set up SDK on your CI build server you can take a look at the [SDK with CI servers](tools/using-ci-with-cli.md) \ndocument. \n\nBy default, the SDK will install in a \"side-by-side\" (SxS) manner. This means that multiple versions of the CLI tools \ncan coexist at any given time on a single machine. How the correct version gets used is explained in more detail in \nthe [driver section](#driver) below. \n\n"}
