run [--framework] [--configuration]\n    [--project] [--help] [--]`\n\n## DESCRIPTION\nThe `dotnet run` command provides a convenient option to run your application from the source code with one command. \nIt compiles source code, generates an output program and then runs that program. \nThis command is useful for fast iterative development and can also be used to run a source-distributed program (for example, a website).\n\nThis command relies on [`dotnet build`](dotnet-build.md) to build source inputs to a .NET assembly, before launching the program. \nThe requirements for this command and the handling of source inputs are all inherited from the build command. \nThe documentation for the build command provides more information on those requirements.\n\nOutput files are written to the child `bin` folder, which will be created if it doesn't exist. \nFiles will be overwritten as needed. \nTemporary files are written to the child `obj` folder.  \n\nIn case of a project with multiple specified frameworks, `dotnet run` will first select the .NET Core frameworks. If those do not exist, it will error out. To specify other frameworks, use the `--framework` argument.\n\nThe `dotnet run` command must be used in the context of projects, not built assemblies. If you're trying to execute a DLL instead, you should use [`dotnet`](dotnet.md) without any command like in the following example:\n \n`dotnet myapp.dll`\n\nFor more information about the `dotnet` driver, see the [.NET Core Command Line Tools (CLI)](index.md) topic.\n\n\n## OPTIONS\n\n`--`\n\nDelimits arguments to `dotnet run` from arguments for the application being run. \nAll arguments after this one will be passed to the application being run. \n\n`-f`, `--framework` [FID]\n\nRuns the application for a given framework identifier (FID). \n\n`-c`, `--configuration [Debug|Release]`\n\nConfiguration to use when publishing. The default value is \"Debug\".\n\n`-p`, `--project [PATH]`\n\nSpecifies which project to run. \nIt can be a path to a project.json file or to a directory containing a project.json file. It defaults to\ncurrent directory if not specified. \n\n## EXAMPLES\n\n`dotnet run`\n\nRuns the project in the current directory. \n\n`dotnet run --project /projects/proj1/project.json`\n\nRuns the project specified.\n\n`dotnet run --configuration Release -- --help`\n\nRuns the project in the current directory. The `--help` argument above is passed to the application being run, since the `--` argument was used.\n"}
