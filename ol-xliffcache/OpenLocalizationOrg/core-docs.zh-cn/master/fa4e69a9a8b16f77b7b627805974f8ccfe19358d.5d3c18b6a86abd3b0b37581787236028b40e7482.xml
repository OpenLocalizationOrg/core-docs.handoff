You'll learn how to structure\nprojects as part of a larger solution, and incorporate unit tests into your projects.\n\nBuild and Run\n-------------\n\nTo build and run the sample, change to the `src/NewTypes` directory and\ntype the following three commands:\n\n`dotnet restore`\n`dotnet build`\n`dotnet run`\n\n`dotnet restore` installs all the dependencies for this sample into the current directory.\n`dotnet build` creates the output assembly (or assemblies).\n`dotnet run` runs the output executable. \n\nTo run the tests, change to the `tests/NewTypesTests` directory and\ntype the following three commands:\n\n`dotnet restore`\n`dotnet build`\n`dotnet test`\n\n`dotnet test` runs all the configure tests \n\nNote that you must run `dotnet restore` in the `src/NewTypes` directory before you can run\nthe tests. `dotnet build` will follow the dependency and build both the library and unit\ntests projects, but it will not restore NuGet packages.\n"}
