Please see that topic for detailed steps on the code\nfor this sample.\n\nKey Features\n------------\n\nThis is the basic Hello World sample for native output. It demonstrates how you build a native\napplication using .NET Core on your platform: Linux, Mac, or Windows.\n\nNote that you can build a native images for any suported platform only from that platform. .NET Core\ndoes not support cross-compiling for supported platform.\n\nBuild and Run\n-------------\n\nTo build and run the sample, type the following three commands:\n\n`dotnet restore`\n`dotnet build`\n`.\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp1.0\\win10-x64\\HelloNative.exe`\n\n`dotnet restore` installs all the dependencies for this sample into the current directory.\n`dotnet build` creates the output assembly (or assemblies).\n`.\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp1.0\\win10-x64\\HelloNative.exe` runs the output executable. The example\nshows the Windows path. Replace `win10-x64` with your platform's RID from the list of\n[supported RIDs](../../../../docs/core/rid-catalog.md).\n"}
